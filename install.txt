Installation and build guide

In order to build Zilverline, you will have to use Maven (http://maven.apache.org/). 

Ant support is deprecated, although the build files are still available, 
they don't work because the necessary libraries need to be downloaded. Maven does this for you.

So, make sure you install maven, or manually download the proper libs (as specified in project.xml dependencies).

After properly installing maven (1.0.2), you just run:

maven test - (optional) to test run, and download proper libraries (you need to have Internet Access)
maven war - to create the war file
maven site - create test reports
maven tomcat:reload - to reload zilverline in tomcat (make sure to check build.properties for tomcat settings)

Happy building and searching.
